Generate in this project a React modular monolith application using Workleap Squide, Web Configs and Logging.

Application requirements:

1- A page to add a new employee
2- A page to edit an employee
3- A page to assign active mandates to an employee
4- A page to list all employees, including inputs to filter/search employees based on multiple criterias and assigned mandates. 

Technical requirements:

- Data should be seeded so the application can be used immediatly.
- There should be an host application and at least one local module.
- The application should be bug free and support being started with a development server. 

To validate that the application is working as expected and do not include bugs, you can use the Chrome Devtools MCP server. If you encouter any issues with an agent skills or the documentation, log those issues in an ISSUES.txt file at the root of the workspace in a format I can understand.
