Analyze the pull request comments generated by each agent and produce a comparison matrix of the reported issues. Include a summary showing, for each agent, the number of issues identified and the corresponding percentage. The percentage should be calculated as the number of issues found by the agent divided by the total number of injected issues for this round. Also list any issues that were missed by all agents. Ensure that all pull request comment pages are fetched and analyzed.
