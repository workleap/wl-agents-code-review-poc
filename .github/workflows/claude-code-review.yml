            - Every reported issue must include a clear fix, with the file path and line number.
            - Skip style preferences, minor nitpicks, and issues typically caught by linters.
            - Do not include positive feedback; focus only on problems.

            IMPORTANT:
            - You must read and follow the review instructions defined in the root AGENTS.md file.

            SEVERITY: Critical (data loss/security breach), High (incorrect behavior), Medium (conditional issues), Low (minor/typos).
