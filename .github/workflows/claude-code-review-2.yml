            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}

            Review PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} for bugs, security issues, and code quality problems.
            Get the diff: gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            RULES:
            - Only flag definite problems introduced by this change (not pre-existing)
            - Every issue must have a clear fix with file path and line number
            - Skip style preferences, nitpicks, or things linters catch
            - No positive observations - focus only on problems

            IMPORTANT: You must read the review instructions from the root AGENTS.md.

            SEVERITY: Critical (data loss/security breach), High (incorrect behavior), Medium (conditional issues), Low (minor/typos).

            Use `gh pr comment` with your Bash tool to leave your review as a comment on the PR.
